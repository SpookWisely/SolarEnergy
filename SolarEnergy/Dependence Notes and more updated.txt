Updated Notes -
This is just shorthand will need to be redone if its needed to put in the proper document.

Feature Importance Notes -

Dependence Graphs -
Current implementation is that when running the regular shap importance calculation I take the top 3 values from the output and parse them individually into their own
dependence graphs.

The logic for these graphs is as follows 

X-Axis - Represents the values of the feature placed in said axis.
Y-Axis - This is represents the combination of the values of said feature and its contribution 
to the models prediction.
Opposite Y-Axis - This usually shows another feature that interacts with the mirroring feature this
is displayed via the coloring of the dots usually as the logic follows Red is more prevelant
and blue is less so.

Graph Outputs -
When looking at the overall results of importance they do differ by quite a large margin on a model
by model basis. Also differing with the different combinations of the datasets that were 
observed (SupplyXweather,DemandXweather and Fully Merged)so the notes will be grouped by said combations.

The parameters of the running of these tests were as follows:
- All used hyper parameters.
- All used an 80/20 split on the test_train_split.
- All were based on hourly lagging.

This was done to keep the testing on as even playing field as possible.


_Fully Merged_ 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- First aspect taken away from looking at the graphs with this combation of datasets including the 
features from both supply and demand weather we see that supplys weather features are 
much more prominent in the upper echelons of the results with this also being the case in the demand
feature importance graphs. Though there are some exceptions to the rule these models being 
MLP,GBDT and NSGA2-CNN. So out of 11 total models in this combination this pattern ends up being the
majority.
--
- When comparng the two resulting graphs we can see that the demand predictions have a wide 
feature importance range. While supply is the opposite with some graphs only really having two prominent
features for example with the "Decision Tree" model, We see the difference in play where the demand feature
importance graph having around 11 features that have a prominent role in the prediciton. While supply only has two
of "CLRSKY_SFC_PAR_TOT_S_t-1" and "ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN_S_t-1". While this is the most extreme case you can see overall
that demand graph results are more populated than the supply.
--
- When looking at the dependence relationship on the top 3 features of each importance graph we can see that 
that the most popular dependence is that on the hour feature. With some others ones occuring though an interesting
observation is that some demand based weather features have a slight dependence on a supply version and vice versa 
and even so these other features may not even have high performance themselves which speaks to the side of keeping 
them in for further testing.

_General Notes for Demand/SupplyXWeather_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Compared to the fully merged when looking at the top 3 results we can see the time based features tend to make
much appearances with supply having 5 out of 10 having either month or hour in the top 3 while demand has the
8 out of 10.
--
- The difference between the supply and demand importance graphs carries over to these combinations as well
with supply having less depth and range than that of the demand on the same model.
--
- The depenence logic stays the same aswell with both supply and demands top features making use of time based
features to help in their predictions. Though with the ommision of no cross dependence since the weather features
are seperate this time.

_To Do_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- What specific reasons are there for why the top models are at the top models technical and datasets info.
- Maybe Test out with limited features based on the feature importance (This might be more time consuming 
than its worth)
