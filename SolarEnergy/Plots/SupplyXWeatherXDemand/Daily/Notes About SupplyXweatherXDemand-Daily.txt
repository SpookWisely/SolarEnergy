Pretty good results overall with MLP coming on top all these are running of the same seed and random state to keep things fair.

Will look into why MLP comes out on top in the end which could a number of reasons. 

As these are the sets of the original dataset I was given I've also made seperate folder containing the results (Plots & final results table) for the dataset with the addition
of the winds columns from Olivers weather dataset.

The main difference while the overall winner has not changed (MLP) the fitting results seem to have increased by a good chunk on all of the models tested and changed some
of the overall ordering of where each model falls in the ranking.

This is to be expected with the addition of more data the better the fit of the model to that of the data and its ability to predict.
